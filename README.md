# Budget Modelling Software
This is a Google Sheets based budgeting software.

## Quick Start
1. Head to the [Google Sheets template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_75YNlc7KBPSW7d82w6NzdktaggdKgAb65zf3edk5-8/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Select "Make a Copy" from the "File" menu. This will create a copy of the template in your Google Drive.

## Purpose & Target Audience
The purpose of the app is to model the consequences of your financial decisions in real time. The questions answered are similar to the following:

- How much money will I have 3 months down the line if I go to an €1500 vacation in a week?
- Am I able to afford a €400/month dental treatment for a year?
- If I am not able to afford something, what are my options to make it happen?

This is a very opinionated piece of software – meaning its user must follow a particular way of reasoning about their financial life to get the most out of the software. Hence this software will most probably not be a good fit for the majority of people.

The assumptions about the user are as follows:

- Their main source of income is selling their time (i.e. employees or freelancers).
- They are disciplined enough to spend about an hour per week to maintain their financial lives in order.
- They do not already have their own opinionated method of maintaining order in their financial lives.

## Model
Financial life of a person is represented in this app with three models:

- Cashflow
- Monthly budget
- Subscriptions

### Cashflow

Inspired by the works of Robert Kiyosaki, this model answers the following questions:

- How much money goes in and out of the pocket each month?
- How much is left each month?
